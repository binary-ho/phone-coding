# Phase 1 Implementation Report 1

This report summarizes the work completed for Phase 1 of the project.

## Completed Tasks

The following tasks from the `implements checklist.md` have been successfully completed:

- **1.1. Set up TypeScript GitHub Action Project Structure**:
  - Initialized `package.json`.
  - Created `src/main.ts`.
  - Created and configured `tsconfig.json`.

- **1.2. Install Dependencies**:
  - Installed all required development and production dependencies, including `typescript`, `@actions/core`, and `@google/genai`.
  - Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules` and build artifacts.

- **1.3. Define `action.yml` Specification**:
  - Created `action.yml` with the specified name, description, inputs, and run configuration.

- **1.4. Configure Build and Packaging**:
  - Installed `@vercel/ncc` for packaging.
  - Added the `build` script to `package.json`.

- **1.6. Phase 1 Final Verification**:
  - Successfully ran the `npm run build` command, which generated the `dist/index.js` file.
  - Verified the contents of `action.yml`.

## Blockers & Notes

- Tasks under **1.5. Set up Authentication Credentials** were skipped as they require manual intervention (obtaining API keys and setting GitHub secrets).
- An issue was encountered where `npm install` did not create the `node_modules` directory between separate command executions. This was resolved by chaining all `npm` commands into a single script within one `run_in_bash_session` tool call, ensuring the environment persisted correctly for the build step.
